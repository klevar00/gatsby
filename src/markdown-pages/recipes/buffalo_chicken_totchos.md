title: "Buffalo Chicken Totchos"
recipe: "Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
Arrange tater tots on a 11x17 inch (28x43 cm) nonstick baking sheet.
Place strips of bacon on a separate baking sheet, and bake along with the tater tots.
Bake the tater tots according to package directions, about 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway.
While the bacon and tater tots cook, prepare your buffalo mixture and cheese sauce.
In a mixing bowl, season chicken lightly with a pinch of salt and pepper. Add the green onions and buffalo sauce. Mix well and keep warm.
In a pot, combine cheddar cheese and cornstarch. Stir until cheese is well coated with the cornstarch. Set the saucepan set over medium heat, adding in evaporated milk and buffalo sauce.
Bring sauce to simmer, whisking constantly until cheese has melted and sauce has thickened, about 5-8 minutes. Set aside and keep warm over very low heat. Stirring occasionally to prevent burning.
Once crispy, remove bacon from oven. Place strips on top of a paper towel to strain excess fat. Chop strips into a rough dice. Set aside
Remove tater tots from the oven once lightly browned on the bottom. Lightly season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
To assemble totchos, layer tater tots followed by the cheese sauce and buffalo chicken onto your serving platter.
Garnish with blue cheese dressing, remaining buffalo sauce, bacon and remaining green onions.
Enjoy!"
