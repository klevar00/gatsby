title: "Gourmet Salmon Dinner"
recipe: "Make the creamy shallot potato puree: Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and cook for 3-4 minutes, until softened.
Add the garlic and another tablespoon of butter and continue to cook for another 3-4 minutes, stirring frequently, until the shallots are browned.
Add the milk, white pepper, and salt and stir to incorporate.
Transfer the shallot mixture to a food processor and process until smooth.
Mash potatoes in a large bowl. Add the shallot puree and continue to mash until fully incorporated. Set aside.
Make the sautéed vegetables: Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until starting to soften.
Push the mushrooms to one side of the pan and add a bit more oil. Add the asparagus and season everything with salt and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, until the vegetables are tender. Remove from the heat and set aside.
Make the salmon: On a cutting board, cut 4 slits in the salmon skin, roughly ¼-inch (6 mm) apart and ½-inch (12 mm) into the salmon flesh. Season with salt, pepper, and thyme leaves.
Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Add the salmon, skin-side down. Cook for 3-4 minutes, or until a lighter pink color has reached ⅓-½ of the way up the side of the salmon.
Flip the salmon and immediately add the butter, garlic, and a few sprigs of thyme. Stir the garlic and thyme around the pan to infuse the flavors and spoon the butter over the salmon for 2 minutes more, until the salmon is cooked through. Remove the salmon from the pan.
Add the potato puree to plates and top with the sautéed vegetables and salmon.
Enjoy!"
