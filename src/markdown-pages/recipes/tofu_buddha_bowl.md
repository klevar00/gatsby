title: "Tofu Buddha Bowl"
recipe: "Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Make the tofu marinade: In a medium bowl, mix together the sesame oil, mirin, Fiery spice blend, and salt.
Cut the tofu lengthwise into ½-inch (1 ¼ cm) wide slabs, then cut each slab in half lengthwise. Cut each strip into ½-inch (1 ¼ cm) wide cubes. Toss with the marinade, then cover with plastic wrap marinate in the fridge for at least 1 hour.
Fill a large pot with cold water, season well with salt, and add the sweet potatoes. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the sweet potatoes can be pierced with a fork but still give some resistance, about 20 minutes.
Remove sweet potatoes from the pot and set aside to cool. Drop in the broccoli florets and blanch for 90 seconds. Remove the broccoli and shock in an ice bath to stop the cooking. Cool completely, about 60 seconds, then transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
Cut the cooled sweet potato into ½-inch (1 ¼ cm) wide half moons and season with salt to taste.
On a lightly greased baking sheet, spread out the marinated tofu and sweet potato. Bake for 20 minutes, until sweet potatoes and tofu begin to brown.
While the sweet potatoes and tofu cook, make the peanut sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, apple cider vinegar, Fiery spice blend, and ¼ cup water. Add more water as necessary to achieve a pourable, but not runny, consistency. Season with salt to taste.
Assemble the bowls: Add 1 cup (170 G) of quinoa to the bottom of a serving bowl, then arrange about 2½ ounces (70 G) of tofu, ½ cup (112 G) sweet potato, ½ cup (75 G) broccoli florets, ½ cup (50 G) purple cabbage, ¼ cup (30 G) cucumber, and 4-5 slices of avocado on top. Drizzle with 2-3 tablespoons peanut sauce and top with crushed peanuts, cilantro, and mint.
Enjoy!"
