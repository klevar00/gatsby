title: "Smoky Oven-Fried Chicken"
recipe: "In a large bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, hot sauce, 2 teaspoons of smokehouse maple seasoning, the onion powder, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of salt, and ½ teaspoon of pepper.
Add the drumsticks to the marinade and turn to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours.
Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack on top.
In a separate large bowl, whisk together the panko, crushed corn flakes, remaining tablespoon of smokehouse maple seasoning, remaining teaspoon of salt, and remaining ½ teaspoon of pepper.
Remove the chicken from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Add the drumsticks to the panko mixture and turn until well coated, pressing the breading into the chicken. Set the chicken on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake for 50 minutes, turning halfway, until golden brown and crispy and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C).
Enjoy!"
